# Dynamic typing vs Static typing 

* Examples of statically typed languages 
	* Java, C++,Swift
	* Here the data type is associated with the variable
	* it cannot be later be assigned with a different data type variable

* Python is dynamically typed
	* The variable is purely only a reference to an object 
	* This can later be assigned a value of different data type
	* the type function type() can be used to find the type of the current variable
	* when you are changing the value of a variable you are not chanigng the value of the object but changin gthe object that is referenced to an object that has the value we need
	* if two variables have the same value they'll be pointing to the same object
