# deepdive_python
Fred Baptiste is an excellent instructor and I'm taking couple of notes from his deep dive into python series.
He starts everything from the basics and leaves no stone unturned. most of the notes are readme's and may not even be neat.
Execute the code in cli with `exec(open(<file_name>).read())` so you can paly around wth it like a pynb
